# Installing `SDL_bgi` in Windows

The easiest way to install `SDL_bgi` is by using the binary packages
provided at <http://libxbgi.sourceforge.net/#download>, for MSYS2 +
mingw-w64, CodeBlocks, and Dev-C++. Alternatively, you can easily
compile `SDL_bgi` yourself, as shown below.

The following sections were tested with:

- msys2-x86_64-20200720.exe (**note:** previous releases may not work!)
- codeblocks-20.03mingw
- Dev-Cpp 5.11 + TDM-GCC 4.9.2


## Installing the MSYS2 + Mingw-w64 Binaries

Let's assume you installed SDL2 as native package, that is
`mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2`.

Start the MSYS2 shell, unzip the `SDL_bgi` archive, then copy 
`src/graphics.h` to `/mingw64/include/`, `src/SDL_bgi.h` to
`/mingw64/include/SDL2/`, and `bin/Mingw64/SDL_bgi.dll` to
`/mingw64/bin`.

Please note that to run a program compiled with `SDL_bgi` outside of
the MSYS2 environment, you will need to copy `SDL_bgi.dll` and
`SDL2.dll` to the same directory as the program.


## Installing the Code::Blocks Binaries

Let's assume that you installed CodeBlocks in `C:\CodeBlocks` and SDL2
development libraries in in `C:\SDL2-2.0.12`. Change the following
instructions as needed for your installation.

Unzip `SDL_bgi` archive, then copy `src/graphics.h` to
`C:\CodeBlocks\MinGW\include`, `src/SDL_bgi.h` to
`C:\SDL2-2.0.12\i686-w64-mingw32\include\SDL2`, and
`bin/CodeBlocks/SDL_bgi.dll` to `C:\CodeBlocks\MinGW\bin`.

## Installing the Dev-C++ Binaries

Let's assume that you installed Dev-C++ in `C:\DevCpp` and SDL2
in `C:\SDL2-2.0.12`. Change the following instructions as needed for
your installation.

Unzip `SDL_bgi` archive, then copy `src/graphics.h` to
`C:\SDL2-2.0.12\i686-w64-mingw32\include`, `src/SDL_bgi.h` to
`C:\SDL2-2.0.12\i686-w64-mingw32\include\SDL2`, and
`bin/DevCpp/SDL_bgi.dll` to `C:\DevCpp\MinGW64\bin`.

To learn how to compile programs, please see `howto_DevCpp.md`.


# Compiling from sources

Windows support is provided for MSYS2 + Mingw-w64 toolchain,
CodeBlocks, and Dev-C++. The MSYS2 shell is required.

Please make sure you have SDL2 development packages. You should
install `make`, `mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2`, and `mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc`.
**Do not** install plain `gcc`. Also, make sure that directory
`/mingw64/bin` in included in the $PATH:

    $ pacman -S make mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2 mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc
    # ...
    $ # expand the $PATH variable
    $ echo export PATH=/mingw64/bin:$PATH >> $HOME/.bashrc

## MSYS2 + Mingw-w64

Start the MSYS2 shell, then run the following commands:

    $ VERSION=2.4.2
    $ tar zxvf SDL_bgi-$VERSION.tar.gz
    $ cd SDL_bgi-$VERSION/src
    $ make
    $ make install

Files will be installed in these directories:

`SDL_bgi_.h`       -> `/mingw64/include/SDL2/`
`graphics.h`       -> `/mingw64/include/`
`SDL_bgi.dll`      -> `/mingw64/bin/`


## MSYS2 + Code::Blocks

Start the MSYS2 shell, then run the following commands:

    $ VERSION=2.4.2
    $ tar zxvf SDL_bgi-$VERSION.tar.gz
    $ cd SDL_bgi-$VERSION/src
    $ PATH=/c/CodeBlocks/MinGW/bin/:$PATH && make -f Makefile.CodeBlocks
    $ make install

Assuming that you installed CodeBlocks in `C:\CodeBlocks` and SDL2
development libraries in in `C:\SDL2-2.0.12`, files will be installed
in these directories:

`SDL_bgi_.h`       -> `C:\SDL2-2.0.12\i686-w64-mingw32\include\SDL2`
`graphics.h`       -> `C:\CodeBlocks\MinGW\include`
`SDL_bgi.dll`      -> `C:\CodeBlocks\MinGW\bin`


## MSYS2 + Dev-C++

Start the MSYS2 shell, then run the following commands:

    $ VERSION=2.4.2
    $ tar zxvf SDL_bgi-$VERSION.tar.gz
    $ cd SDL_bgi-$VERSION/src
    $ PATH=/c/CodeBlocks/MinGW/bin/:$PATH && make -f Makefile.DevCpp
    $ make install

Assuming that you installed Dev-C++ in `C:\DevCpp` and SDL2
development libraries in in `C:\SDL2-2.0.12`, files will be installed
in these directories:

`SDL_bgi_.h`       -> `C:\SDL2-2.0.12\i686-w64-mingw32\include\SDL2`
`graphics.h`       -> `C:\SDL2-2.0.12\i686-w64-mingw32\include`
`SDL_bgi.dll`      -> `C:\DevCpp\MinGW64\bin`


## Test Programs

Once `SDL_bgi` is installed, you can compile some test programs you
can find in the `test/` directory. Type:

    $ cd test && make

Please see the `using.md` file in the `doc/` directory.

Enjoy!
