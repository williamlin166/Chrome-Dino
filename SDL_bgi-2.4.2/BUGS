BUGS
----

- visualisation problems on NVIDIA GK208BM (GeForce 920M) with 
nvidia-driver-450 on GNU/Linux. As far as I can say, this is an NVIDIA
driver problem.

- In MSYS2 + Mingw-w64, the getch() function may hang. This is a
problem in MSYS2/Mingw-w64 console handling.

- According to the original BGI documentation: "If a string is printed
with the default font using outtext or outtextxy, any part of the
string that extends outside the current viewport is truncated."
SDL_bgi follows this rule, but bgidemo.c running in Turbo C 2.01 does
not. This is a Turbo C bug; please see `tmp/truncate.c`.

Please report bugs if you find any.
